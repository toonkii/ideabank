* registration/login/view

* accepted ideas become listed and can be voted on by subscribers.
* voting periods, start and end dates were voting is allowed.
* idea search.
* site policies.
* administration (categories, moderators, moderation, registration, login, manage users)
* keep track of the status of ideas, research, implemented, ideas maybe cloned and tweaked just like on github.
* an idea has a unique short name, a name and a description. Then there maybe various sections for implementing the idea, finance, resources, benefits.

What benefit can a system like this bring to paid up subscribers. Will need some sort of a brainstorming facility, mind maps, whiteboard and whiteboard capture.

What will keep bring people back?

What does it take to bring an idea to fruition? Research this.
